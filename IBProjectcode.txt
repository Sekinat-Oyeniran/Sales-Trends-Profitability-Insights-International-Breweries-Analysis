--INSIGHT--
/*
The profit worth of the breweries in the last three years is N105,587,420.00
The Francophone countries generated more profit than the Anglophone countries by 19.70%. 
The highest profit was generated in 2017, with 36.47%, this decreases to 35.10% in 2018, 
and further decreases to 28.43% in 2019.
The top three brands that generated the highest profit are castle lite, budweiser, and eagle lager. and are beer
The least selling brands that generated the lowest profit are trophy, hero, and grand malt.
In 2019, hero and grand malt were highest selling brands while the highest selling brands (castle lite and budweiser) 
had the least quantity sold. This may be responsible for the loss.
Additionally, sale increases during dry season (December - March), which leads to the high profit 
generated during this season and vice versa. Sales gradually decreases during rainy season (April - October).
Senegal generated the highest profit of #21 million (20.35%), followed closely by Nigeria with #21 million (20.25%), 
Ghana with #21 million (19.9%), and Benin with #21 million (19.85%). Togo recorded the lowest profit. 
This may be attributed to the fact that Togo's highest-selling brand, Grand Malt, is among the least popular brands overall."
Sales vary from region to region based on brand's consumption and demand in each country. 
The top three regions that generated the highest profits are southsouth, west, and northcentral and the 
regions that generated the least profits are northeast, southeast, and northwest
*/

-- Recommendation --
-- Invest in top selling brands,
-- Benin and Togo are the least performing countries in sales. The company should create market awareness
-- of popular products in these countries.
-- The top performing countries in sales Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana, they should promopte sale of malts in these
countries --
